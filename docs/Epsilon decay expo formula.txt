eps_decay=(eps_min/eps)^(1/num_episodes)


Note: alpha is the learning rate [0, 1). Larger values of alpha make the agent learn more quickly (and viceversa). 
So low value -> previous values for Q of (s,a) are strongly preserved,
high value -> new values for Q of (s,a) are strongly looked up to.

Note: discount factor [0, 1).
low value -> new rewards are weakly valued,
high value -> new rewards are strongly valued.
